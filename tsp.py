	Nearest Insertion TSP : By Soo-Min, Ava, and Alston
	<# I'm open to using a different alg too ~Ava >
		Starting from a degenerate tour consisting of the two closest 
	cities, repeatedly choose the non-tour city with the minimum 
	distance to its nearest neighbor among the tour cities, and insert 
	it in between the two consecutive tour cities for which such an 
	insertion causes the minimum increase in total tour length.
